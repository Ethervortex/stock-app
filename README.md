# stock-app

This stock market app is a 10 credit project developed for the Fullstack Open course at the University of Helsinki.

The application is a web application designed for monitoring stock markets. It fetches real-time stock data from a stock API, allowing users to track historical data for both indices and individual stocks. Detailed information and fundamental metrics for individual stocks can also be displayed. Users can create their own stock portfolios within the application, which are saved in a database. Additionally, users can create watchlists and screen stocks based on selected metrics.
