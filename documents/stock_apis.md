# Comparison of **free** stock market APIs

| API Name       | Update Frequency | Free Tier Limits       | Link                         | Review                |
|----------------|------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Polygon.io  | End of day        | 5 API calls/min    | [Link](https://www.polygon.io/pricing)          | fundamentals, technical, 2 years historical but **no real-time data** |
| Alphavantage | End of day | 25 requests per day | [Link](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/) | good documentation, lots of fundamentals,  +15 years of history data,  **no real time** |
| Twelvedata | Real-time | 800 API credits/day | [Link](https://twelvedata.com/) | 1 call is 1 credit or more, it is unclear what 800 daily credits actually mean |
| Finnhub | Real-time | 60 API calls/min | [Link](https://finnhub.io/pricing) | only US market and market data for 50 symbols |
| Financial Modeling Prep API | End of day | 250 calls/day | [Link](https://intelligence.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/pricing) | 5 year historical, **no real-time** |
| Barchart On Demand | Real-time | ? | [Link](https://www.barchart.com/ondemand/api) | global markets, availability of free tier is questionable - requires registration first |
| EODHD | 15 min delayed | 20 API calls/day | [Link](https://eodhd.com/) | only 20 calls/day for free, 1 year history data |
| Marketstack | End of day | 100 API calls/month | [Link](https://marketstack.com/product) | number of calls in free tier is very limited |
| Yahoo Finance | Real-time | ? | [Link](https://developer.yahoo.com/api/) | unofficial API, probably based on webscraping and thus unreliable |
| Bavest | ? | ? | [Link](https://www.bavest.co/en) | this provider requires more research as sign-up is required |


### Conclusion

Free real-time stock market APIs are relatively scarce and often come with strict limitations. For those needing real-time data, Twelvedata and Finnhub offer options, but with restrictions on the number of calls. Alphavantage provides a robust range of market coverage and fundamental data, though it is limited to end-of-day updates in its free tier.

Barchart On Demand and Bavest could offer additional options but require further investigation. For comprehensive and real-time data, web scraping might be a necessary approach to bypass these limitations.
